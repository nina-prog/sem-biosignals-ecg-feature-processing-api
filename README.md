# Pipeline Framework
*...TBD...Description about using FAstAPI...*

# Pipeline Description
This pipeline is designed to process ECG data from raw signals to HRV features. It is implemented as a FastAPI to be 
used inside an application. However, it is also designed to be possibly be used later on in a web application, where the 
user can upload ECG data and receive the HRV features. 

Short Overview:
* Input (plus device): *...TBD...*
* Output: *...TBD...*
* Input data form: JSON implementing ECGBatch and ECGSample models. See [below](#input-data-form) for more details. 
* Output data form: JSON implementing a Pandas DataFrame containing the HRV features for each window for each sample given in the 
batch. See [below](#output-data-form) for more details.

## Input Data Form
Examples for the Input are implemented in the code and can be seen when running the api via the /docs user interface. 
However, here is an overview of the Input model and its attributes, including their type, constraints and description.

This code defines two Pydantic input models, ECGSample and ECGBatch, for validating and processing data related to 
electrocardiogram (ECG) biosignals. 

**ECGBatch** is a model for representing a batch of ECG data from multiple subjects in an experiment. It has the 
following attributes:

| **ECGBatch**  | ****            | ****         | ****            | ****                                                                                                  |
|---------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Parameter** | **Type**        | **Optional** | **Constraints** | **Description**                                                                                       |

| record_date   | date            | False        | N/A             | Date on which the ECG data was recorded. If not provided, the current date is set as the default.     |
| samples       | list[ECGSample] | False        | N/A             | A list of ECGSample objects representing the results of the experiment for all subjects.              |
| configs       | dict or None    | True         | N/A             | A dictionary containing the configuration settings used during the experiment. Default value is None. |

**ECGSample** is a model for representing the results of a single subject in an ECG experiment. It has the following 
attributes:

| **ECGSample**     | ****                        | ****         | ****            | ****                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Parameter**     | **Type**                    | **Optional** | **Constraints** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| label             | list[str] or None           | True         | min_items=2     | A list of labels corresponding to each timestamp in the timestamp_idx list. If not provided, a default list with the same length as timestamp_idx and ecg is generated with "undefined" as its value. |
|                   |                             |              |                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

The models use Pydantic's validation features, such as Field and validator, to ensure that the input data meets certain 
requirements, such as the length of the timestamp_idx, ecg, and label lists being the same. The Config class in each 
model then includes an example which can be seen in the code and also in the interface as mentioned above. Pydantic 
also enables someone to use this example as default input to test the routes, so no effort is to be taken defining a 
new example.

## Output Data Form
The output data is a Pandas DataFrame containing the HRV features for each window for each sample given in the batch. This is then converted to a simple records JSON format. The DataFrame has the following columns: 

| **Column** | **Type** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| sample_id | str      | ID of the sample. |
| subject_id | str      | ID of the subject. |
| window_id | int      | ID of the window. |
| w_start_time | datetime      | Start time of the window. |
| w_end_time | datetime      | End time of the window. |
| mean_rr | float      | Mean RR interval in the window. |
| sdnn | float      | Standard deviation of the RR intervals in the window. |
| rmssd | float      | Root mean square of the successive differences of the RR intervals in the window. |
| nn50 | int      | Number of successive differences of the RR intervals in the window that are greater than 50 ms. |
| pnn50 | float      | Percentage of successive differences of the RR intervals in the window that are greater than 50 ms. |
| lf_band | float      | Power of the low frequency band in the window. |
| hf_band | float      | Power of the high frequency band in the window. |
| lf_hf_ratio | float      | Ratio of the low frequency band power to the high frequency band power in the window. |

**Dataframe Example:**

**Outlook:** Add more columns for the HRV features, such as:
* rr | list[float]      | List of RR intervals in the window.
* rpeaks | list[int]      | List of R-peak indices in the window.

# Tutorial

# Outlook
* Add parameter "feature_selection" (str or list[EnumFeatures], default=all) to input class ECGBatch: select features 
which shuold be computed. *Example: list: [feature_x, feature_y, feature_z]; str: "HRV" -> computes defined "basic" HRV 
Features, "default" -> computes all features, "time-domain" -> computes only time domain features*
* Add new route "preprocess_ecg_data" to main.py: only execute preprocessing part of the application and do not compute 
the features.
